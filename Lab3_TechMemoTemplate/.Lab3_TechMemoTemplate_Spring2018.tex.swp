\section*{Abstract}
%\Large \textbf{Abstract} \\
\normalsize
%The abstract section should contain a summary of what was performed in the lab and should be approximately  200 words.  This should succinctly rephrase the purpose of the laboratory.  It should also refer to the data collected.    \textbf{The abstract should specifically mentioned the Th\'evenin resistance and voltage obtained, as well as the various methods used.}

This laboratory exercise created a complex circuit were a Thevenin voltage and resistance was determined. To determine the equivalent voltage, a break was placed across the load resistor and the voltage was measured. The equivalent resistance was found by removing independent sources and placing a test source. The current through the test source will indicate the equivalent resistance in the Thevenin circuit. The ammeter in the multimeter was used to measure this current while the volt-meter was used to measure the break voltage.

\section {Introduction and Theory}

%Include 1-2 paragraphs that explains the scope of the experiment. Briefly introduce the concept of Th\'evenin's equivalent circuit.  What was the primary purpose of the experiment? If the data collection has deviated in any way from the rest of your section (for example you had to come back to collect more data), explain this in a second paragraph.  In particular, be sure to note if your data was acquired from a different lab than your classmates/using different equipment. 

The scope of this experiment was to find the equivalent Thevenin circuit by measuring the break voltage and the current through a test source. A Thevenin circuit is one consisting of a voltage source and a resistor. According to Thevenin law, this circuit can represent any complex circuit with any configuration of current or voltage sources whether they be dependent or independent.

\subsection{Theory: Circuit Topology}
%In this section, you should introduce the reader to the circuit  investigated in the experiment, and demonstrate the theoretical value of the circuits. 

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item A figure of the circuit schematic should be included here.  You can use a figure from PSPICE. Be sure to indicate what the load resistor is.  Students using \LaTeX  may ask Dr. Rommel permission to use the Circuitikz artwork used in the laboratory handout. Use of the artwork should be appropriately acknowledged as a citation and under the acknowledgements. If you do use Circuitikz, please let Dr. Rommel know what version you are using.  Some recent updates (discovered while writing this handout/tempalte) have changed the way voltage polarity is presented.  You will hae to edit the values of the resistors. 
%	\item Define the ground in the circuit and specific nodes. 
%	\item This description can be short (a few sentences in length).
%\end{itemize}

The circuit in question 

%\subsection{Theory: Hand Calculations and PSPICE of Th\'evenin Equivalent Circuit}
%\colorbox{yellow}{\textcolor{blue}{Hand calculations are \textbf{not} required for this lab report.}}

\subsection{Theory: PSPICE Simulation Summary}
Begin by providing a 1 paragraph description of the PSPICE setup.  Which \textbf{libraries} and \textbf{PSPICE elements} were used in the simulation? You can borrow from the text of your first tech memo here.  If you do so, please be sure to cite the tech memo. Note the libraries used. You can find the information when you look at the properties of each element.  There will be a reference to a ``.olb'' file.  This is the library name. 

Include a description of the resistor sweep.  Specifically, what is the funcction of the \textbf{PARAMETER/SPECIAL} element?   Also, what type of simluation was run? What were the start/stop resistor values? What was the step size, and was it linearly or logarithmically varied?    Comment about the line fit in Excel (or whatever software was used to perform the linear regression).

The lab handout called for using parameters in the tutorial, which were edited during your prelab to match the resistors in this lab.  What changes were made to the parameters?  Also, why were unique names given for Net Aliases in each circuit?
\subsubsection{Theory: PSPICE Schematic Diagram}
Since the prelab called for having all 4 circuits on the same page, you may place two copies of the schematic here as listed in Figs. \ref{Fig:SchematicVoltMarkers} and \ref{Fig:SchematicCurrentMarkers}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\vspace{2in}
	\caption{Screen shot of the PSPICE schematic with voltage markers.}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\vspace{2in}
	\caption{Screen shot of the PSPICE schematic with current markers.}
	\label{Fig:SchematicCurrentMarkers}
\end{figure}
Include a brief description of the figures (which subcircuit is which-i.e., The upper right schematic diagram is the Variable Load).
\subsubsection{Theory: PSPICE Simulation Varying Load Circuit}
 In this section, include: 
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item A figure with the plot of $R_L$ vs. $v_{L}$ from PSPICE.
 	\item A figure with the corresponding linear regression in Excel that illustrates the resulting scatter plot and extraction of $R_{th}$. 
 	\item Present the equation generated by Excel in the text of the report.
 	\item Be sure to indicate the $r^2$  value with the equation. You may need to change the output precision of Excel if the $r^2$ value appears to be ``1''.  Realistically simulation results will show a ``1''.
 	\item Table \ref{Table:Lab3VariableLoadPSPICE} shows the Thevenin voltage and resistance calculated from the excel document. The results agree with that of the tutorial.

 	\end{table}
 \end{itemize}
 
\subsubsection{Theory: PSPICE Simulation Open Circuit/Short Circuit Test}
 In this section, include: 
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Explain how the PSPICE schematic was altered for the open circuit voltage test and short circuit test. The entire discussion (including all bullets below) should be about 1 paragraph
 	\item Refer to the Fig. \ref{Fig:SchematicVoltMarkers} with a screen shot of the schematic in PSPICE with voltage markers for the $V_{oc}$ test.  As you likely have already placed this figure in your theory section, there is no need to do so a second time.  
 	\item Refer to Fig. \ref{Fig:SchematicCurrentMarkers} with a screen shot of the schematic in PSPICE with current markers for the $I_{sc}$ test.  As you likely have already placed this figure in your theory section, there is no need to do so a second time.

 	 	\end{tabular}
 	 \end{table}
 \end{itemize}
 
Table \ref{Table:Lab3VocIscPSPICE} shows the $R_{th}$ calculations when the voltage across the load is measured with a break and the current through the load is measured with a short. The results agree with the PSPICE simulation.
 
\subsubsection{Theory: PSPICE Simulation Test Signal Method }
 In this section, include:

 	\item Refer to the Fig. \ref{Fig:SchematicCurrentMarkers} with a screen shot of the schematic in PSPICE with current markers for the Test signal.  As you likely have already placed this figure in your theory section, there is no need to do so a second time.  
 	
 
 	\item The results in Table \ref{Table:Lab3ReqTestSignalPSPICE} agree with the results from $V_{OC}$ and $I_{SC}$ in the tables about. This table shows the thevenin resulting circuit if a 1V source was added.

\section{Hardware Experiment: Results and Discussion}
This section of the report should present what was done in hardware.  A reader should be able to recreate an experiment from the detail present.  One section discusses the equipment used in the experiment. The remaining sections discuss the results for each circuit.
\subsection{Equipment Used in the Laboratory}
Write a short paragraph to detail the equipment used in the laboratory, and specific model numbers. Ideally, you should create a table of the equipment which should be referred to in text (See Table \ref{Table:Equipment} as an example).  The room location where the experiment was performed should be included.  Note that this should be a part of all Tech Memos, as it is an essential piece for other users to replicate your experiment.  \textbf{As you will be likely using the same equipment throughout the term, once the text/tables are established, you may reuse the information with the permission of your instructor/TA. Again, cite your first lab report as a reference.}

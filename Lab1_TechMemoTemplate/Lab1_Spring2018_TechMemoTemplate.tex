\Large \textbf{Abstract} \\
\normalsize
In the first part of this exercise, the software portion, a circuit with three resistors (two 5.6 k\si{\ohm}, 1 k\si{\ohm}) in series was designed in PSPICE, a circuit design, and simulation program. The resistors were listed with tolerances. A simulation was run to display a histogram of likely outcomes given the tolerance and resistance rating of each resistor. A Monte Carlo simulation displayed a statistical analysis of the likely outcomes of testing the circuit. In the hardware portion of the exercise, the circuit was implemented on a breadboard. The voltage was measured across each resistor given a supplied voltage of 5V. An effective resistance was measured along with resistance from each resistor. Finally, the voltage of each node relative to ground was measured and recorded. These experimentally determined values were compared to those calculated using the voltage division laws to analyze the circuit.

\section {Introduction and Theory}

Write a paragraph to describe the objectives of the laboratory.  After this, follow the section headings in the template, including the required figures.

\subsection{Theory: Circuits Investigated}

In this section, you should introduce the reader to the circuits you investigated in the laboratory, and demonstrate the theoretical value of the circuits. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Include a figure that illustrates  Circuit 1's schematic.  To simplify the number of figures you will need later in the report, it is recommended that you use the schematic diagram you build in PSPICE for each circuit.  The figure should have a caption below as illustrated in Figure \ref{Fig:Circuit Schematics}. Note that a 2 inch blank space has been left for placing the figure's graphics.
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\vspace{2in}
		\caption{Schematic diagram for Circuit 1. }
		\label{Fig:Circuit Schematics}
	\end{figure}
	
	\item The schematic of the circuit should be described here in a short paragraph.  An example of the text is in the lab handout, Section 4.1.  As a guide, rephrase the text in your report. 
\end{itemize}
%\subsubsection{Theory: Equivalent Resistance}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Calculate the series resistance for each of the circuits as hand calculation. 
%	\item Include these calculations in a common equation such as Eqs.  \ref{Eq:ReqSeries} and \ref{Eq:ReqCircuit2}.  Rather than writing the equations as symbols, rewrite them with numbers and the final answer.
%	\begin{subequations}
%		\begin{equation}
%			\label{Eq:ReqSeries}
%			R_{eq,Circuit1}=R_1+R_2+R_L= SOLVE
%		\end{equation}
%		\begin{equation}
%		\label{Eq:ReqCircuit2}
%		R_{eq,Circuit2}=R_1+R_2+\left( R_L \parallel R_{L2} \right)=SOLVE
%		\end{equation}
%	\end{subequations}
%\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theory: Kirchhoff's Voltage Law and Voltage Division}
In this section, you should briefly introduce the reader to the concepts of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law and Voltage Division.  You do NOT need to derive expressions for each here. For each circuit:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Determine the voltage drop across \textbf{each} circuit element via hand calculations.  \textbf{Use this information to determine the nodal voltages.}
	\item Integrate the calculations into the text of the document. You do not necessarily need to show every detail here. The final results of the calculations should be listed in Table  at the end of the report.
	\item Please \textbf{DO NOT} include a scanned image of hand calculations for this report.  They should be typed into the text, with equation numbers on the right hand side. %For example, in the case of Circuit 1, the text might say (see next bullet):
	%\item The voltage across the load resistor in Circuit 1 may be determined from voltage division as illustrated in Eq. \ref{Eq:VoltageDivisionExample}.
%	\begin{equation}
%		\label{Eq:VoltageDivisionExample}
%		V_{RL}=\left(V_{supply}\right)\frac{R_L}{R_1+R_2+R_L}
%		       =\left(5 ~\si{\volt}\right) 
%		       \frac{1000 ~\si{\ohm}}
%		       {5600~\si{\ohm}+5600 ~\si{\ohm}+1000~\si{\ohm}}
%		       =\mbox{\textbf{SOLVE}}
%	\end{equation}
%	\item Repeat this calculation for Circuit 2 by appropriately including the second load resistor in the equation.  
\end{itemize}
%\subsubsection{Theory: Kirchhoff's Current Law and Current Division}
%In this section, you should briefly introduce the reader to the concepts of Kirchhoff's Current Law and Current Division.  You do NOT need to derive expressions for each here. 
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Determine the current through each branch of Circuit 2.  Show that Kirchhoff's Current Law holds. 
%		\item You will need to determine the current leaving the voltage supply (one sentence and corresponding equation).
%		\item Next use current division to determine the current through each of the load resistors via current division (one sentence, two equations)
%	\end{itemize}
%\subsubsection{Theory: Power Balance}
%In this section, you should briefly introduce the reader to the concepts of conservation of power. For each circuit:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Determine the power absorbed by each circuit element and show that the net sum of powers=0. 
%	\item There should be one equation for each circuit, and a brief summary.  
%\end{itemize}
\subsection{Theory: PSPICE Simulation Summary}
Begin by providing a 1 paragraph description of the PSPICE setup. Was a DC simulation used, transient simulation, etc.?  Which \textbf{libraries} and \textbf{PSPICE elements} were used in the simulation? As you develop your lab reports this term, aspects of this text may be applicable in future reports.  In order to determine the libraries used, you can find the information when you look at the properties of each element.  There will be a reference to a ``.olb'' file.  This is the library name.   Look to the Appendix in Prof. Rommel's PSPICE tutorial if you are not sure as to the names/nomenclature.  For example, the resistors used are ``R/ANALOG'' from the \textbf{analog.olb} library. 
 
\subsubsection{PSPICE: DC Simulation of Circuit 1}

In this section, include: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item A figure with a screen shot of the schematic in PSPICE with  voltage markers (Fig. \ref{Fig:Circuit1VoltageMarkers}).  
	%\textbf{For simplicity, your  current and power data will only be reported on the figures with the current and power markers.}

		\centering
		\vspace{2in} % % % % % Replace with Include graphics statement
		\caption{Circuit 1 with voltage markers. }
		\label{Fig:Circuit1VoltageMarkers}
	\end{figure}
	\item Briefly comment about the results and whether they agree with your hand calculations. This should be one to two sentences in length and written in paragraph form. 
	\item The PSPICE values will be reported  in Table \ref{Table:Circuit1}.

In this section, include:

	\item Report the mean and sigma from the Monte Carlo histogram.

\section{Hardware Experiment: Results and Discussion}
This section of the report should present what was done in hardware.  A reader should be able to recreate an experiment from the detail present.  One section discusses the equipment used in the experiment. The remaining sections discuss the results for each circuit.
\subsection{Equipment Used in the Laboratory}
Write a short paragraph to detail the equipment used in the laboratory, and specific model numbers.

The room location where the experiment was performed should be included.  Note that this should be a part of all Tech Memos, as it is an essential piece for other users to replicate your experiment.  \textbf{As you will be likely using the same equipment throughout the term, once the text/tables are established, you may reuse the information with the permission of your instructor/TA.}
